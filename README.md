# MaximumGraphPath
*This is the second part of alghoritms and data structures project done in the academic year 2020/2021*

Determinating maximum path in a weighed graph with no cycle. Data is contained in a file in which the first line contains two integer  separated by a space: the first one is number of nodes, second is P the number of the arches. The next P lines each contain three numbers: I1, I2 and Q. These means that node I2 can be reached by node I1 and Q the weight of the arch between the two nodes.
